# DIM self-development root

This is the minimal, security-sensitive root repository for DIM's own Project.
The reviewed [`.dim`](.dim) lifecycle bootstraps the private development
runtime and assembles the independently managed repositories under
`/workspace`. Ordinary source, tests, tooling, examples, and specifications do
not live in this repository.

[`.dim/repos.yml`](.dim/repos.yml) is the reviewed repository catalog. The
lifecycle clones the `development` repository at `/workspace` and the other
registered repositories as siblings (`core`, `core-development`, plugin
source and development pairs, `verification`, `examples`, and
`specification`). Existing agent-controlled checkouts are never modified by
the trusted outer lifecycle.

Create the split self-development Project from the root branch:

```bash
dim project create dim \
  --bootstrap-git-url https://github.com/slop-lab/dev-infra-manager.git \
  --bootstrap-git-ref dev/root
dim workspace create dim dim-dev
dim workspace run dim-dev codex
```

The root lifecycle clones missing registered managed repositories into
`/workspace` using the runtime catalog. It never runs Git against an
existing agent-controlled checkout; agents fetch, switch, and update those
repositories from inside their private development runtime. Run local source
checks from the assembled development workspace:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
just check-source
```
